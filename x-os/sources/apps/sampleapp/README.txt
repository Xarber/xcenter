In boot.xlaunch there are all the files to make an app for X-OSbatch.
Open the file or extract it with WinRar or an archive app;
Replace the content of app folder with your ones;
Edit data.info inserting your app informations;
Change icon.bmp with your own logo (MUST BE .BMP EXTENSION);
Get all the content and put it in a new zip;
Rename the zip in boot.xlaunch;
REMEMBER: IF BOOT.XLAUNCH IS BIGGER THAN 24MB THAN YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UPLOAD IT TO X-STORE;
          YOU MUST DIVIDE SINGLE FILES USING boot.xlh1 / boot.xlh2 etc.
You're done! Now you have your own X-OS App!

PS: DIRECTLY PUT THE ARCHIVE FILES TO THE ROOT OF IT:
